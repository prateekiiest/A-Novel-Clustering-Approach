# Clustering


## Abstract

Clustering is one of the most important topics under machine learning and is used to find potential structure in the data, how the data items are similar to each other.Clustering is a method of unsupervised learning and is a common technique for statistical data analysis used in many fields.

In Data Science, we can use clustering analysis to gain some valuable insights from our data by seeing what groups the data points fall into when we apply a clustering algorithm. 

Here we propose a new clustering approach to gather data points that are highly similar to each other into one cluster and separate the points that are highly dissimilar in nature.

## Data Set 

We use the iris data set in our case to evaluate our model in this respect.
